This dataset contains the data of 25 healthy young adults who completed a delay discounting task during fMRI scanning and on a separate vist, completed a PET scan with the high-affinity dopamine D2/3 receptor tracer [18F]fallypride.
PET data for each participant were acquired in 3 sessions separated with short breaks for participant comfort. Dynamic tomograph images from the 3 sessions provided have been merged and realigned. PET images were reconstructed with decay correction, attenuation correction, scatter correction, and calibration. PET data for each participant are provided in three ways: (1.) raw unprocessed timeseries with timing information, (2.) binding potential (BPND) parametric image calculated using the simplified reference tissue method (SRTM) in the participant's original PET space (smoothed with a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), and (3.) BPND parametric image calculated using SRTM (from PET space map) transformed to MNI152 2mm standard space using the participant's structural T1.
